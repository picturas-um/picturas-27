# PictuRAS

**Your personal, intuitive and powerful image editor.**

PictuRAS is a web-based image editing platform that combines traditional image processing with AI-powered tools. It is built as a **microservices architecture** orchestrated with Docker Compose, and it is the code base for the group project of the curricular unit _Requisitos e Arquitetura de Software_ (RAS), University of Minho.

> **This repository is a starting point, not a finished product.**
> It is the result of two previous academic years of student work (see [Authors](#-authors)). It contains working features, known limitations and technical debt — finding, documenting and improving those is part of your job this semester.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Image Processing

- **Basic Editing**: brightness, contrast, saturation adjustments
- **Geometric Operations**: resize, rotate, crop
- **Filters and Effects**: binarization, borders, watermark
- **Bulk Processing**: apply a pipeline of tools to multiple images

### AI-Powered Tools

- **Background Removal** (`bg_remove_ai`): AI-powered background removal for clean cutouts
- **Smart Cropping** (`cut_ai`): saliency-based intelligent cropping
- **Object Detection** (`obj_ai`): object detection and classification with YOLO
- **People Detection** (`people_ai`): person detection and counting
- **Text Recognition** (`text_ai`): OCR for text extraction from images
- **Image Enhancement** (`upgrade_ai`): AI-driven quality improvement and upscaling
- **Generative Expand** (`expand_ai`): outpainting / canvas expansion, backed by a generative
  image API (a local **mock** of the Stable Diffusion WebUI API ships with the project, so no
  GPU or external API key is required)

### User Management and Platform

- **Authentication**: user registration and login with JWT
- **Field-level encryption**: sensitive user fields are encrypted at rest in MongoDB
- **Subscription Plans**: free and premium tiers with different daily usage limits
- **Project Management**: organise images and editing pipelines into projects
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based progress updates while tools run
- **Encrypted object storage**: MinIO with server-side encryption at rest (KMS auto-encryption)
- **Automated backups**: periodic `mongodump` of all three databases

## 🏗️ Architecture

All traffic enters the system through a single **HTTPS reverse proxy (Nginx)**. Internal services
are **not** published to the host unless noted otherwise — they talk to each other over the
`elk` Docker bridge network.

```

The **WS Gateway talks only to RabbitMQ**: it consumes `ws_queue` and pushes progress events to
the browser over Socket.IO, authenticating the connection with the shared `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. It
has no link to any other microservice. Note that **`subscriptions` means paid memberships**
(plans, cards, billing status) — it is unrelated to WebSocket/event subscriptions.

### Frontend

- **Technology**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Container port**: 3000 — **not published**, reachable only through Nginx
- Talks to the backend through the relative base URL `/api-gateway/`

### Backend Services

| Service                   | Container port | Responsibility                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**           | 8000           | Single entry point for the REST API, JWT checks |
| **User Service**          | 10001          | Registration, authentication, user profile      |
| **Project Service**       | 9001           | Projects, image pipelines, tool orchestration   |
| **Subscription Service**  | 11001          | Plans, payments (mock), usage limits            |
| **Image Storage Service** | 11000          | Upload/download façade in front of MinIO        |
| **WebSocket Gateway**     | 4000           | Real-time progress events to the browser        |

### Processing Tools

Each tool is an independent Python microservice that consumes a RabbitMQ queue, processes the
image from the shared `image_data` volume, and publishes the result back to the `picturas`
exchange:

`binarization` · `border` · `brightness` · `contrast` · `cut` · `resize` · `rotate` ·
`saturation` · `watermark` · `bg_remove_ai` · `cut_ai` · `expand_ai` · `obj_ai` · `people_ai` ·
`text_ai` · `upgrade_ai`

> The `watermark` tool runs from a pre-built public image
> (`prcsousa/picturas-watermark-tool-ms`) instead of being built from this repository — it is a
> deliberate example of integrating a third-party service.

### Infrastructure

- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (asynchronous tool invocation)
- **Databases**: three independent MongoDB 4.4 instances (users, projects, subscriptions)
- **Object Storage**: MinIO with encryption at rest
- **Reverse Proxy / TLS termination**: Nginx
- **Backups**: `mongo-backup` sidecar running `mongodump` every 24h into `./backups/mongo`
- **Monitoring**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) — present but **commented out**
  in `docker-compose.yaml` and `nginx/nginx.conf`

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement        | Minimum                   | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Docker Engine**  | 24+                       | Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS                              |
| **Docker Compose** | v2 (`docker compose`)     | The old `docker-compose` (v1) hyphenated command is not used |
| **RAM**            | 8 GB free (16 GB advised) | ~25 containers, several with AI models loaded                |
| **Disk**           | ~15 GB free               | AI base images (PyTorch, OpenCV) are large                   |
| **Browser**        | Any modern browser        | Must accept a self-signed certificate                        |

On Docker Desktop, raise the memory limit in **Settings → Resources** if the AI tools get
OOM-killed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/picturas-um/picturas-27 picturas-27
   cd picturas-27
   ```

2. **Build and start the whole stack**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   The **first** build downloads several GB of images and installs the Python AI dependencies —
   expect **15–30 minutes** depending on your connection. Later starts take seconds:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d      # detached
   docker compose logs -f    # follow the logs
   ```

3. **Open the application**

   👉 **<https://localhost:8080>** — note the **`https`** and the port **`8080`**.

   Your browser will warn you about the self-signed certificate. Accept it
   (Chrome: _Advanced → Proceed to localhost (unsafe)_; Firefox: _Advanced → Accept the Risk_).
   See [HTTPS and Certificates](#-https-and-certificates) if the site does not load at all.

4. **Stop the stack**

   ```bash
   docker compose down          # stop and remove containers
   docker compose down -v       # ...and wipe all data (databases, images, MinIO)
   ```

### First Steps

1. Open <https://localhost:8080> and accept the certificate.
2. Register an account, or use the anonymous mode.
3. Create a project and upload an image.
4. Build a pipeline with the toolbar (filters, geometry, AI tools) and run it.
5. Watch the progress arrive live over the WebSocket, then download the results.

## 🔌 Ports and Endpoints

Everything a user needs is behind **one** address: `https://localhost:8080`. The remaining
ports are published only for **development and debugging**.

### Through the reverse proxy (HTTPS)

| `7860`  | Generative mock API  | <http://localhost:7860> (used by `expand_ai`)   |
| `27018` | MongoDB (projects)   | `mongodb://localhost:27018`                     |
| `27019` | MongoDB (users)      | `mongodb://localhost:27019`                     |

Make sure the ports above are free before starting; see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting).

## 🔐 HTTPS and Certificates

Nginx terminates TLS on container port `443`, published on host port `8080`. A **self-signed**
certificate pair is committed to the repository so the stack works out of the box:

```
certs/selfsigned.crt      # used by Nginx — the only certificate the browser sees
certs/selfsigned.key
```

Seven further self-signed pairs are committed under `apiGateway/`, `users/`, `projects/`,
`subscriptions/`, `minio/`, `frontend/` and `imageStorageService/`. The internal services use
them to speak HTTPS to each other (`https://users:10001`, `https://projects:9001`, ...).

The bundled certificate is issued to `CN=localhost` and is valid until **14 September 2027**, so
it covers the whole academic year. To regenerate it (for a different hostname, or after it
expires):

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout certs/selfsigned.key \
  -out certs/selfsigned.crt \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"

docker compose restart nginx
```

> ⚠️ **The internal certificates are expired, and that is why nothing breaks.**
> All seven service-to-service pairs expired in **January 2026**. The stack keeps working
> because every client is built as `https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })`, so expiry —
> and in fact the whole certificate chain — is never checked. Internal traffic is encrypted
> but **not authenticated**, and the client certificates passed to those agents are never
> requested by any server. Treat this as a finding to analyse, not a pattern to copy: fixing
> it (proper validation, or dropping internal TLS in favour of a trusted network boundary) is
> a legitimate architectural improvement. Only `certs/`, used by Nginx, is still valid.

**Why HTTPS matters here:** the browser refuses to open a secure WebSocket (`wss://`) from a
page served over plain HTTP, and several browser APIs used by the editor require a secure
context. Always use `https://localhost:8080` — **not** `http://`, and **not** `localhost:3000`.

> 🔎 **Committed secrets are a known issue.** Private keys, JWT secrets and database passwords
> are hard-coded in this repository for convenience. That is acceptable for a local
> setup but _unacceptable in production_ — moving them to a `.env` file (git-ignored) or a secrets
> manager is a good first improvement.

## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration currently lives as `environment:` entries in `docker-compose.yaml`.

| Variable                                      | Default                       | Service(s)          | Purpose                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`                              | `lisan_al_gaib`               | users, gateway, ws  | JWT signing key — **must match everywhere** |
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`                        | `uma-frase-secreta-...`       | users               | Key for field-level encryption in MongoDB   |
| `FREE_DAILY_OP`                               | `5`                           | users               | Daily operation limit for free accounts     |
| `SECRET_KEY`                                  | `card_secret_key`             | subscriptions       | Payment-data encryption key                 |
| `MINIO_ROOT_USER` / `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`     | `admin` / `admin123`          | minio, img_storage  | MinIO credentials                           |
| `MINIO_KMS_SECRET_KEY`                        | `picturas-key:...`            | minio               | Key used for encryption at rest             |
| `MINIO_KMS_AUTO_ENCRYPTION`                   | `on`                          | minio               | Encrypt every object automatically          |
| `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` / `_PASS`             | `user` / `password`           | rabbitmq            | Broker credentials                          |
| `RABBITMQ_HOST` / `_PORT` / `_USER` / `_PASS` | `rabbitmq` / `5672` / ...     | tools, projects, ws | Broker connection                           |
| `FRONTEND_URL`                                | `https://localhost:8080`      | img_storage         | CORS / redirect origin                      |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`                    | `/api-gateway/`               | frontend            | Relative API base (keep it relative!)       |
| `GEN_EXPAND_URL`                              | `http://generative-mock:7860` | expand_ai           | Generative image API endpoint               |

⚠️ If you change `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, change it in **all three** services (`users`, `api_gateway`,
`ws_gateway`) or authentication silently breaks.

### Persistent data

Named Docker volumes: `user_data`, `project_data`, `subscription_data`, `image_data`,
`minio_data`, `rabbitmq_data`. Database dumps are written to the host at `./backups/mongo`
(git-ignored). `docker compose down -v` deletes every volume — the dumps survive.

### Scaling

- Run more instances of a busy tool: `docker compose up -d --scale brightness_tool=3`
- Watch queue depth in the RabbitMQ management UI (<http://localhost:15672>)
- Tune per-container CPU/memory limits in `docker-compose.yaml` to match your machine

Containers are named `picturas-<service>-<n>` (from `name: picturas` in `docker-compose.yaml`),
independently of the directory you cloned into. Use `docker compose -p <other-name>` to run a
second, separate stack.

### Enabling the ELK stack (optional)

The Elasticsearch / Logstash / Kibana services are commented out at the top of
`docker-compose.yaml`, together with the matching `location` blocks in `nginx/nginx.conf`.
Uncomment both to enable centralised logging — budget an extra ~4 GB of RAM.

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Rebuilding a single service

```bash
docker compose up -d --build users        # rebuild + restart one service
docker compose restart nginx              # config-only change, no rebuild needed
docker compose logs -f projects           # follow one service's logs
docker compose ps                         # what is running, and is it healthy?
```

### Live code reloading

`users`, `subscriptions`, `apiGateway` and `frontend` bind-mount their source directory into
the container, so edits on the host are visible inside it. The Node services run under
`nodemon` and reload automatically.

The **frontend image is built for production** (`bun run build` / `bun start`), so a source edit
will **not** hot-reload. For frontend development either rebuild:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build frontend
```

...or switch `frontend/Dockerfile` to the dev command already prepared there
(`CMD ["bun", "dev"]`, commented out at the bottom of the file).

Python tools have no bind mount — rebuild them after every change:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build border_tool
```

### Adding a new tool

1. Create `Tools/<your_tool>/` with `<your_tool>.py`, `requirements.txt` and a `Dockerfile`
   (copy an existing simple tool such as `border` as a template).
2. Reuse `Tools/utils/` for RabbitMQ connection, image handling and message schemas.
3. Register the queue in `rabbitMQ/`.
4. Add the service to `docker-compose.yaml` with `depends_on: rabbitmq (service_healthy)` and
   the `image_data` volume.
5. Expose it in the project service and in the frontend toolbar.

### Inspecting data

```bash
docker compose exec users_mongoDB mongo --port 27019
docker compose exec projects_mongoDB mongo --port 27018

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

**The page does not load / `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`**
You are probably using `http://` instead of `https://`, or port `3000` instead of `8080`. The
only correct address is <https://localhost:8080>.

**"Your connection is not private" / `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`**
Expected — the certificate is self-signed. Accept the warning once per browser profile. If
Chrome refuses outright, type `thisisunsafe` with the warning page focused.

**Uploads or live updates fail although the page loads**
The browser blocks mixed content and insecure WebSockets. Make sure every request goes through
`https://localhost:8080` and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` stays the **relative** value
`/api-gateway/`.

**`Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated`**
Another process holds the port. Find it with `lsof -i :8080` (macOS/Linux) or
`netstat -ano | findstr :8080` (Windows), then stop it or remap the port in
`docker-compose.yaml` (`"8081:443"` → browse to `https://localhost:8081`).

**A tool container keeps restarting**
Check `docker compose logs <tool>_tool`. The usual causes are RabbitMQ not being healthy yet
(it recovers on its own) or the container being OOM-killed — increase Docker's memory limit.

**AI tools are very slow the first time**
Some models are downloaded or warmed up on first use. `Tools/models/yolov5su.pt` is committed,
but other weights are fetched at runtime — the first request needs network access.

**`expand_ai` fails**
It depends on `generative-mock` being healthy. Check <http://localhost:7860> and
`docker compose logs generative-mock`.

**Login works, then every request returns 401**
`JWT_SECRET_KEY` differs between `users`, `api_gateway` and `ws_gateway`.

**Everything is broken after pulling new code**
Rebuild from a clean slate:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

**Out of disk space**
`docker system prune -a --volumes` reclaims unused images and volumes — it also **deletes your
local data**, so use it deliberately.
